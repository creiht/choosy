# Choosy Gifs

This is a basic search engine for giphy gifs.  It is just a fun project to learn some new things and reacquaint myself with some old things :)

It is written using Python 3, Flask, and Material Design Lite.

## Running a Dev Instance

1. Download this repo.
2. Install the requirements:
  * `pip3 install -U flask`
  * `pip3 install -U giphy_client`
  * `pip3 install -U pytest` (For testing)
3. Initialize the DB:
  * `./init_db.sh`
4. Run the flask server with the Choosy app:
  * `./run.sh`
5. Browse to http://localhost:5000/
6. Register a user and have fun!

## Future improvements

1. Mock out the giphy api calls so that we can have better test coverage.
2. Add proper DB support (currently uses SQLite with a light DB abstraction).
3. Add caching layer (Redis or similar) for session information and caching api calls.
4. Explore JS Frameworks to add a more dynamic app experience.
5. Improve tag management.
